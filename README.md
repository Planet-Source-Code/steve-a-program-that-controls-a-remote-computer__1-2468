### Description

The code is still here, however I am working on an updated version. It will include a new chat, and several other things. If anyone is interested in joining me in creating this program email me at steve81@mediaone.net. Basicly what I am looking to do is get people who may know some cool control functions to add to it, and how to do them. I welcome all to join. It is only on request though, there is no money involved, however you will get your name in the credits, and if you have a website that too.
